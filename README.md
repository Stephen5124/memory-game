# Memory-Game
Memory game is an interactive web-based game designed to enhance and showcase my skills in React, SCSS, and Python. This project aims to build a challenging and engaging memory game with a 12x12 grid layout, where players match pairs of cards. The game will be developed using React for the frontend, emphasizing state management, component lifecycle, and responsive design. SCSS will be utilized to create dynamic styles and animations, offering a sleek and intuitive user interface. Additionally, Python will be employed for backend development, managing game logic, user scores, and possibly a leaderboard system. The project serves as a practical application to deepen my understanding of full-stack development and to demonstrate my abilities in creating an interactive web application.
