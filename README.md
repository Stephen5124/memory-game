# Memory-Game
Memory game is an interactive web-based game designed to enhance and showcase my skills in React, SCSS, and Python. This project aims to build a challenging and engaging memory game with a 12x12 grid layout, where players match pairs of cards. The game will be developed using React for the frontend, emphasizing state management, component lifecycle, and responsive design. SCSS will be utilized to create dynamic styles and animations, offering a sleek and intuitive user interface. Additionally, Python will be employed for backend development, managing game logic, user scores, and possibly a leaderboard system. The project serves as a practical application to deepen my understanding of full-stack development and to demonstrate my abilities in creating an interactive web application.

Key Learning Objectives:

    React Development: Gain proficiency in React fundamentals, component design, state and props management, and hooks.
    Advanced SCSS: Enhance skills in SCSS for styling, focusing on animations, layouts, and responsive design techniques.
    Python Integration: Strengthen backend development skills with Python, including setting up a server, API development, and data management.
    Full-stack Application: Understand the workflow and challenges of building and integrating a full-stack application.

Features:

    Interactive 12x12 Grid: A large grid to increase the game's challenge and engagement level.
    Card Flipping Animation: Smooth and visually appealing animations for flipping cards using SCSS.
    Game Logic: Implemented in Python, handling the game mechanics, tracking user moves, and calculating scores.
    Responsive Design: Ensuring the game is playable across various devices and screen sizes.
    User Score Tracking: Backend logic to track and store player scores.
    Leaderboard: A leaderboard to display high scores, encouraging competitive play.

Project Goals:

    To create a fun and engaging memory game that can be played on various devices.
    To utilize this project as a practical learning experience in React, SCSS, and Python.
    To develop a portfolio piece that demonstrates my skills in full-stack development.
